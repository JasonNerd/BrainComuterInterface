# Improvise a Jazz Solo with an LSTM Network

## Problem Statement

* Note Representation: pitch AND duration
* In practice, it is more sophisticated: one might press down two piano keys at once
* The model is trained on random snippets of 30 values taken from a much longer piece of music

## Model

* `Lambda` can be used to define arbitrary operation in Keras
```python
x = Lambda(lambda X: X[:,t,:])(X)  # select the "t"th time step vector from X
```
* Reshaping a tensor with `Reshape`
```python
reshapor = Reshape((1, 78))
```
* Model creation with `Model`
```python
model = Model(inputs=[X, a0, c0], outputs=outputs)  # Multiple inputs are allowed
model.fit([X, a0, c0], list(Y), epochs=100)
```

## Sampling new Music

* Use trained model to get output at time = t
* Sample from generated probabilities
* Feed to next time t + 1
* Initialize `a`, `x` and `c` with zeros
* Post processing is needed to transform one hot encoded note into actual pitch and duration
