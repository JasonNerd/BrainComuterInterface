# EEG(Electroencephalography, 脑电描记法; 脑电图学)
EEG provides the recording of electrical activity of the brain from the surface of the scalp.

## How does it work
Electrodes are placed on the scalp to pickup the electrical current generated by the brain. When firing(放电), a neuron forms a **dipole**(神经元形成偶极子), with a lower voltage at **synapses(突触)** and higher voltage at the **axon(轴突)**. If it's an **inhibitory neuron(抑制神经元)**, the dipole is flipped, with lower voltage at axon and higher voltage at the synapses. 
* What causes this **voltage shift**(电压变化) inside a neuron?
Na+ channels open on **along the dendrite**(沿着树突), causing a flood of positive electrons, this **positive charge**(正电荷) moves down the axon, opening more sodium channels(钠离子通道), and causing an electric charge to carry down the axon, discharging at the synapse, releasing **neurotransmitters(神经递质)** along with it.

EEG data contains rhythmic activity, which reflects neural oscillations. Oscillations are described by frequency, power and phase.

Oscillations occur at specific frequencies (i.e., at a certain rate). These include delta, theta, alpha, meta, and gamma. Research has found associations between these rhythms and different brain states. For example, commercial EEG headsets - often used for purposes such as meditation - typically measure the amount of brain activity that occurs in the alpha frequency.

当神经元集群足够大时，EEG就可以在头皮表面探测到这一放电信号。注意EEG仅能测量神经元集群信号。优点是成本相对较低、便携，因而关于EEG技术有大量的成熟的算法。**脑电图数据包含节律性活动**，反映了神经振荡。振荡用频率、功率和相位来描述。研究发现了这些节律和不同大脑状态之间的联系。例如，商业脑电图耳机——通常用于冥想等目的——通常测量发生在α频率的大脑活动量。

## 空间分辨率(Spatial resolution)
The spatial resolution of EEG is determined by **the number of electrodes used**. In research, when higher spatial resolution is desired, typically at least 32 electrodes are used, up to 256. **In general, spatial resolution for EEG is low** (e.g., compared to ECoG and fMRI) because the signal needs to travel through different layers up to the skull. The resolution, however, can be improved using certain types of filters or by combining EEG with other tools. The spatial precision of EEG is fairly low but can be improved by spatial filters such as the surface Laplacian(表面拉普拉斯) or adaptive source-space-imaging techniques(自适应源空间成像技术). Also spatial accuracy is low, because the activity registered by an electrode is the mixture of different signals generated by different brain regions, close and distant from the one placed under the electrode. 此外，空间准确度也很低，因为电极记录的活动是大脑不同区域产生的不同信号的混合，这些区域与电极下方的区域有近有远。

## Time resolution
EEG benefit is its excellent time resolution. **It is possible to take thousand of snapshots of electrical activity across different sensors in a single second.** In EEG is possible to use multiple electrodes, up to 500, based on the experiment. They are used mounted on caps to allow collecting the data from the same scalp region.

## EEG可能测量的电信号
The signals possible to measure through EEG are:
1) Action potentials along the axons connecting neurons
2) currents through the synaptic clefts(突触间隙) connecting axons with neurons/dendrites
3) currents along dendrites from synapses to the soma of neurons (23)
脑电图测量的是大脑中发生的电活动。记录的是最小两个电极之间的电压差。为了解释ERP，需要从多个电极同时记录脑电图。在神经元树突的突触激发过程中，产生d的电流被EEG接收。检测到的信号很差，z这是由于电极距离神经元很远，信号要穿过骨头和头骨，要记录电流就需要一个放大器。
The electrodes acquire the signal from the scalp, the amplifiers process the analog signal to enlarge the amplitude of the EEG signals so that the A/D converter can digitalize the signal in a more accurate way. Finally, the recording device, which may be a personal computer or similar, stores, and displays the data.

## 总结
BCI可以使用任何类型的大脑成像。其中包括功能磁共振成像(fMRI)、PET和近红外成像(NIRS)，它们依赖于血流的变化(即血流动力学反应)，以及脑磁图(MEG)和脑电图(EEG)，它们分别测量大脑的磁和电活动。功能磁共振成像和近红外成像的空间分辨率较高，但时间分辨率较差;MEG和PET具有较高的时空分辨率;脑电图具有空间分辨率低、时间分辨率高的特点。目前，功能磁共振成像(fMRI)和脑磁图(MEG)依赖昂贵、笨重的设备;PET需要向血液中注入放射性物质。因此，依赖于近红外光谱的方法，特别是脑电图，是最常用的。

## EEG实验步骤
### 1. preprocessing
The raw EEG data is often not clean because affected by noise and artifacts. There are four main sources of noise and artifacts,
which are:
1. EEG equipment
2. Electrical interference external to the subject and recording system
3. The leads and electrodes
4. The subject: electrical activity from the heart, eye blinking, eyeball movements, muscles movements in general
The preprocessing step helps to clean the data from the noise and artifacts. There are different methods and different steps in preprocessing. Often for example, filters are applied to the data. 
### 2. Feature Extraction 
The next step is feature extraction: the analysis of the signal and extraction of information. There are many methods for feature extraction, some of them are: Band powers (BP) Cross-correlation between EEG band powers frequency representation (FR) time-frequency representation (TFR) Hjorth parameters, parametric modelling inverse model and specific techniques used for P300 and VEP such as Peak picking (PP) and Slow cortical potentials calculation (SCPs)
### 3. Classification 
Another step which can be applied to the signal, now mostly clean from artifacts, is to apply classification algorithms. Using machine learning techniques it is possible to train a classifier to recognize which features, for example, belongs to one or another class.mathematical Again, the classification helps to find out which kind of mental task the subject is performing (Ochoa, 2002)
### 4. Translation
After the signal has been classified, the result is passed to the feature translation algorithm. At this point the features need to be translated in the corresponding action required. “For example, a P3 potential could be translated into the selection of the letter that evoked it” So, in this case, the algorithm will send a command to the feedback device, to select the letter.
### 5. Feedback device
The feedback device receives the command from the translation step. For example it can be the computer, where the signal will be used to move a cursor, or it could be a robotic arm where the data are used to allow movement.

## Security
Brain based authentication(脑纹识别). EEG Biometrics is a growing field which looks at how we can use your eeg activity to be able to identify someone. Similar to one’s fingerprint, your brain activity can be used as a form of authentication.

## Biofeedback Therapy(生物反馈疗法)
* 焦虑缓解。Neurofeedback can be an effective method of handling anxiety. Similar to the methods used in mindfulness practices, alpha and theta training is done in order to put the person in a more relaxed state of mind.
* 改善睡眠. Sleep research has been using EEG’s for a long time. Recently, startups have been leveraging consumer grade eeg designs to **measure the quality of your sleep**.
* ADHD(attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 注意力不集中症).Although a controversial use case , there are many neurofeedback clinics and few companies who have created solutions to help manage ADHD.
* PTSD(post-traumatic stress disorder, 创伤后应激障碍). A lot of the studies focus on getting the participants to generate alpha wave activity which is associated with being in a relaxed state. Most articles which were reviewed suggest that neurofeedback should be
use in combination with other treatments.

## 诊断
1. Concussion(震荡；脑震荡). 提供一个初步的判断，以决定是否进行PET/MRI扫描. Research has shown that there are noticeable changes in EEG oscillations(振荡) after brain injury. This leads to the potential of creating **eeg diagnostics**(脑电图诊断). Current solutions like Brainscope, don’t actually predict if a concussion is present. However it does provide some preliminary insight to clinicians so that they can determine if a person should get a PET/MRI scan.

2. Alzheimer’s(老年痴呆症). A growing body of evidence suggests that EEG analyses can be used in the early detect of Alzheimer’s and may even allow for the diagnosis for different dementia subtypes(诊断不同的痴呆亚型). Most of the research has been done in academic environments, however there could be the potential to develop low cost medical testing devices(低成本的医疗检测设备).
